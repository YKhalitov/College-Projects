# Dragonboard-12-Light
The final project from Programming Embedded Microcontrollers in C and Assembly.

Using the Dragonboard 12 light board, register manipulation and onboard circuitry,
a project is created that simulates the function of a microwave without the heating element.

Things such as the display, door latching (opening/closing), food spinning and more 
are all simulated.

Setup steps & more are described in the usermanual included.
